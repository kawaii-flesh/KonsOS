The structure of the file system KonsOS FS
In the boot sector there is a structure that contains the information necessary for the file system.
At the end of the file storage area, there must be a magic number (8 bytes 0xff), which is needed for the file loader

File structure
The first 10 bytes of the structure contain the file name, if the file name is less than 10 bytes, then you need to add it with spaces (0x20).
Then there are 2 bytes that store the file size in bytes
And the last byte that stores the file type:
0x0  - is just a file
0xff - executable file
After the structure goes the contents of the file

Examples:

A simple file

db "file.txt", 0x20,0x20; filename
dw ef - sf; size
db 0; type
sf:
db "Hello, I'am simple file!"
ef:

Performing

db "clear"
db 5 dup (0x20)
dw end_clear - start_clear
db 0xff

start_clear:
mov ah, 0x0f
int 0x10
xor ah, ah
int 0x10
ret
end_clear:
